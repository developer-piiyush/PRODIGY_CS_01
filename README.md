# PRODIGY_CS_01
Project: Implement Caeser Cipher. In this project, i write a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

# 🛡️ Caesar Cipher – Prodigy InfoTech Internship (Task 1)

This is a simple Python implementation of the **Caesar Cipher**, developed as part of the **Prodigy InfoTech Cybersecurity Internship**.

## 🔐 What is Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest known encryption techniques. It works by shifting the letters of the plaintext by a fixed number (called the shift key) in the alphabet.

Example: Plain Text: HELLO
         Shift: +3
         Encrypted: KHOOR


## 🚀 Features

- 🔒 Encrypt a custom message using a shift value  
- 🔓 Decrypt an encrypted message  
- ✅ Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters  
- 🛡️ Ignores symbols and spaces for secure, readable output

## 🧠 How It Works

- **Encryption:** Shifts each character forward in the alphabet by the shift value  
- **Decryption:** Shifts each character backward using the same value  
- Uses basic logic and ASCII manipulation in Python

## 📂 Files

- `caesar_cipher.py` → Main Python file to run the program  
- `README.md` → Project description

## 🖥️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed (`python --version`)
2. Open terminal/command prompt
3. Navigate to project folder
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python caesar_cipher.py
